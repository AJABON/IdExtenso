##### [180309]
  - **Yalt** module. Various fixes and improvements.
  - **Settings** module. Added the `hasScope` method to quickly answers questions like, _is there a SESSION-scoped parameter among my settings?_, etc.
  - **MD5** module. Slight enhancement of the trace: it now shows the input string if it has less than 50 characters.

##### [180307]
  - **File** module. Changed the default temp file suffix into `txt` (since `tmp` may cause the OS to simply ignore the `execute` method.) Also, `File.temp()` now provides a fallback mechanism in case `execute()` returns `false`.

##### [180302]
  - Added the **Complex** class for making easy to deal with complex numbers. Many operators and methods are available.

##### [180226]
  - **BigInt**. Better implementation of the `+` operator when a `BigInt` is mixed with a string. Now interpreted as a `concat` operation. So `"Result: " + BigInt(1000)` will prompt `Result: 1000` as (likely) expected. Idem with `BigInt + str`.

## 1.80225
  - `Ext/number` now performs a polyfill for `Number`'s static members specified in ECMAScript 2015. Namely: `EPSILON`, `MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`, `MIN_SAFE_INTEGER`; and the methods `isInteger()` and `isSafeInteger()`. From now you can use code like `if(Number.isInteger(x)){...}` in your project.
  - Important fix in the **BigInt** module. In `prototype['<']` and `prototype['<=']` the _reversed_ argument wasn't listened to, so the scheme `number < this` was improperly parsed as `this['<'](number)`, leading to serious problems! For example, `999 < BigInt(1000)` was said false. ([Detail](https://github.com/indiscripts/IdExtenso/blob/master/etc/%24%24.BigInt.jsxlib#L2720).)

##### [180221]
  - `Settings` updated. Various bugs fixed. Now supports session-persistent keys :-)

##### [171205]
  - `Ext/regexp` now provides the static method `RegExp.escape()`, inspired by [Benjamin Gruenbaum](https://github.com/benjamingr/RegExp.escape). Basically, you can inject the result of `RegExp.escape(myString)` into a regex with no edge effect. This implementation offers a 2nd parameter, `intent`, in order to fine-tune the process in special contexts, in particular those that may involve *literal* regexes.
  - `Ext/patterns`: added regexes intended to deal with escape issues: `RegExp.RESC` (canonical escaping class), `RegExp.RSAF` (stronger security), `RegExp.RLIT` (literal intent.)
  - `Ext/strings`: our great `String.prototype.toSource` method now allows the `quotes` param to be `false` (strictly), so that the result is not nested within quotes and does not *backslash* inner quotes. Handy in special cases (playing with literal regexes, etc.)

##### [171203]
  - `Ext/file` added, intended to extend `File.prototype`. So far it only introduces the method `nudeName()` which just returns the file name without its extension. (REM: Do not confuse `Ext/file` with the **File** module.)
  - Exposed the `stamp()` utility in the API of the **File** module. It basically invokes the private `~.STMP` function, which builds a unique name for temporary files. Call `$$.File.stamp()` to use this feature from anywhere.

##### [171202]
  - Updated the **File** module to keep it in sync with local changes, but still working on making it cleaner...

##### [171130]
  - Added the **Markov** module (`/etc`), a simple (and fast) implementation of Markov chain.

##### [171125]
  - Various unnotified changes in **JSON**. The `lave` function now supports a third param `FORCE_OBJ` that allows to browse special objects (such that `ScriptUI`, `BridgeTalk`…) which otherwise wouldn't expand. Also, the `DOM_ACCESS` param can be set to `-1`.
  - `Ext/number`: Implementation notes and small fixes.

##### [171122]
  - `Ext/enum`: the `revSource` method had no name. Fixed.
  - `Ext/regexp`: the `==` operator had no name. Fixed.
  - `Ext/string`: the `charSet` method had no name. Fixed.

## 1.71112
  - Added the `$$.help()` utility. See `core/Root/$$.help.jsxinc`. Display all API infos available from the included modules.
  - Added the `Function.prototype.send` utility, available at including stage. Provides to any public or private method being declared the ability to invoke `<context>[<meth>](this,x,y)` then return itself.
  - Enhancement of function signatures (_casting_) in various `etc/` modules (**Random**, **SHA**, **BigInt**).

##### [171110]
  - `Ext/patterns`: Added a regex for capturing ExtendScript operators (`RegExp.EXOP`).

##### [171109]
  - Added the `__core__` property in `MODULE` and `CLASS` macros (`$$.jsxinc`).

##### [171105]
  - Added the `/tools` subdir (intended for extra dev tools.) Not part of the framework.

##### [171103]
  - The entry point (`$$.jsxinc`) now calculates the engine state before `$$.load()`.
  - Typo fixed in `$$.Env.engineState`.
  - `$$.load` updated (**Root**). In case IdExtenso's name is not `"$$"`, remove the key `$$` from `[[global]]`. This cleanup step was previously done from `~.ISCL()`, but it is better to keep `$$` available up to this point. 

## 1.71024
  - **Env** now exposes the `runningScript` property (URI pathname to the running script file.)
  - **Log**: Added an explicit `typeof logLevel` test, since ExtendScript wrongly regards `undefined < 0` as true!
  - Added `$$.isModule()` in **Root**. Tells whether a path, or a function, refers to a module.
  - `$$.error()` entirely rewritten.
  - **Web module**: Added an error case in `get()`.
  - Various unnotified changes.

##### [170609]
  - `Web.get()` now supports https on Win platforms (through VBS, non-modal state assumed.) See `~.ALTG` in `/etc/$$.Web.jsxlib`.

##### [170608]
  - 'JSON Hook' mechanism introduced to allow any ***IdExtenso***-compliant module or class to inject its own method for 	generating a source string. Details in `/core/$$.JSON.jsxlib`.
  - Added `toSource()` in **BigInt** prototype (`/etc/$$.BigInt.jsxlib`), and implemented its own JSON hook (see the private `JSON` method) in compliance with **JSON** module. As a result, `$$.JSON(BigInt(123456),0)` outputs the compact string `'BigInt("123456")'`, while `$$.JSON(BigInt(123456),1)` returns the expanded object source with no `BigInt` reference, that is, `'{ "neg" : 0, "size" : 1, "0" : 123456 }'`.

##### [170607]
  - Added a few comments to the **JSON** module (core), pending to address a design issue, namely, *how is JSON supposed to deal with IdExtenso-based entities, such as modules or BigInt instances?…* Ongoing reflection.

##### [170606]
  - Introducing the **SHA** class (`/etc/$$.SHA.jsxlib`), the complete family of Secure Hash Algorithms as defined in FIPS PUB 180-4, FIPS PUB 202, and FIPS PUB 198a (HMAC). Implements: SHA-1, SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512, SHA-3-224, SHA-3-256, SHA-3-384, SHA-3-512, SHAKE128, and SHAKE256. The subclass **Int64** (`/etc/SHA/$$.Int64.jsxlib`) encapsulates 64-bit integer structure for bitwise calculations (taking advantage of ExtendScript's operator overloading.)

##### [170603]
  - Cosmetic addition: background & notice of the **MD5** module (`/etc/$$.MD5.jsxlib`).

##### [170601]
  - Added the **Random** class (`/etc/Random.jsxlib`) and its dependencies, cf. `/etc/Random/` directory.

## 1.70527
  - Major additions in both the entry point `/$$.jsxinc`, the root module `/core/$$.Root.jsxlib`, and the function extension `/core/Ext/$$.function.jsxinc`. A new macro is introduced, `CLASS`, which allows to declare the underlying module as a constructor (i.e, it can instantiate things) while preserving the overall paradigm of the framework (`[PUBLIC]` vs. `[PRIVATE]` zones.) Unlike regular MODULE entities, a CLASS module supports the keys `[STATIC]` (equiv. to `[PUBLIC]`) and a specific one, `[PROTO]`. The latter is used for prototyped members. A class builds instances through a `create()` method which, if available, is automatically invoked by the constructor (that's something of a factory.)
  - Added a (single) call to `$.hiresTimer` in `$$.load()` for the purpose of storing a load timestamp in microseconds. Made public via `$$.getLoadStamp()`. To be used by entropy collectors.
  - Introducing the extra module `/etc/BigInt.jsxlib`, aka **BigInt**, a huge piece of code which implements in pure ExtendScript the famous BigInteger interface. Once included, just use `$$.BigInt("123456789123456")` to handle an immutable arbitrary-precision integer. **BigInt** operators are overloaded so that you can compute expressions such as `(X*9999)%Y-(Z+1234)`, where `X,Y,Z` are **BigInt**.

##### [170521]
  - Fixed integer code (`U53 -> I53`) in `$$.casting.jsxres`.

##### [170512]
  - Major update of the **Env** module now including a Windows version checker based on `File.batchToString("VER > %1")`. Allows to fix OS signature in ExtendScript versions that return a wrong `$.os` string.
  - Updated `File.batchToString()` in the **File** module. Now requires a `%1` placeholder for the temporary output.
  - Added `readUTF16()`, `writeUTF16()`, and `appendUTF16()`.

##### [170511]
  - Added `File.batchToString(/*str*/myCommand)` in the **File** module. For the time being this method is only available to Windows platforms. It allows to quickly send a batch command that supports `> file` output, and returns the result as a string. For example, `$$.File.batchToString("VER")` returns the result of the command `> VER`. Handy and transparent!

##### [170510]
  - Added the byte type (i.e `int8`) in `$$.casting.jsxres`.

##### [170508]
  - Better type checking in `$$.success()`—making sure it treats the relevant params as strings.

##### [170504]
  - Added the _Window.update()_ trick in `~.SLMG()` (sleep message), thanks to https://forums.adobe.com/message/9484275#9484275.

##### [170501]
  - Slight improvement of `JSON` module: safer `NaN` string no longer relying on `[[global]].NaN` (which is writable.)

## 1.70428
  - Included the messaging API (quick prompts etc.) in the Root module. Method: `$$.success(message)`.
  - Added `$$.Web.browse(url)` (in `etc/Web` module), which allows to open an url in the client-side browser.

##### [170427]
  - Added `File.macLineFeed()`, `File.winLineFeed()`, and `File.unixLineFeed()` to control newline character(s) during file creation.

##### [170426]
  - Bug fixed in `Web.get()` when `isText` option was turned ON. (No data were returned.)

##### [170424]
  - Added `Yalt.hasKey()` (check whether a translation key is present.)
  - Fixed `Yalt.onLoad()` signature.

##### [170423]
  - Added `prefix` and `zeroPad` params to `Number.prototype.toHexa` [*`core/Ext/$$.number.jsxinc`*]

##### [170422]
  - Various unnotified changes (*JSON*, *Env*, etc.)

## 1.70407
  - IdExtenso alpha release.

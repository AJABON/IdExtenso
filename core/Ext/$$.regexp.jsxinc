	CONSTRUCTOR CALLED AS A FUNCTION. - RegExp(pattern, flags)
	If pattern is an object R whose [[Class]] property is "RegExp" and
	flags is undefined, then return R unchanged. Otherwise call the RegExp
	constructor, passing it the pattern and flags arguments and return
	the object constructed by that constructor.
	
	(a) RegExp(myRegExp)             =>  returns myRegExp unchanged.
	    myRegExp===RegExp(myRegExp)  =>  true (tested in all ExSc versions.)
	
	(b) RegExp(myRegExp,"any")       =>  TypeError (tested.)
	
	(c) RegExp("pattern","any")      =>  new RegExp('pattern','any')

	CASE INSENSITIVITY. - In case-insignificant matches all characters are
	implicitly converted to upper case immediately before they are
	compared. However, if converting a character to upper case would
	expand that character into more than one character (such as converting
	"ß" (\u00DF) into "SS"), then the character is left as-is instead. The
	character is also left as-is if it is not an ASCII character but
	converting it to upper case would make it into an ASCII character.
	This prevents Unicode characters such as \u0131 and \u017F from
	matching regular expressions such as /[a-z]/i, which are only intended
	to match ASCII letters.

	Even if the pattern ignores case, the case of the two ends of a range
	is significant in determining which characters belong to the range.
	Thus, for example, the pattern /[E-F]/i matches only the letters E, F,
	e, and f, while the pattern /[E-f]/i matches all upper and lower-case
	ASCII letters as well as the symbols "[", "\", "]", "^", "_", and "`".

	ESCAPING. - A ClassAtom can use any of the escape sequences that
	are allowed in the rest of the regular expression except for \b, \B,
	and backreferences. Inside a CharacterClass, \b means the backspace
	character, while \B and backreferences raise errors. Using a
	backreference inside a ClassAtom causes an error.

	[ECMA2009] The characters / or backslash \ occurring in the pattern
	shall be escaped in S as necessary to ensure that the String value
	formed by concatenating the Strings "/", S, "/", and F can be parsed
	(in an appropriate lexical context) as a RegularExpressionLiteral that
	behaves identically to the constructed regular expression. For
	example, if P is "/", then S could be "\/" or "\u002F", among other
	possibilities, but not "/", because /// followed by F would be parsed
	as a SingleLineComment rather than a RegularExpressionLiteral. If P is
	the empty String, this specification can be met by letting S be "(?:)".
	
	But the above rules are not implemented in ExtendScript!

	// IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
	//==========================================================================

	/*

	0. JSON PURPOSE: toString() vs source / toSource() / uneval.
	__________________________________________________________________
	
	[ECMA] The `source` property of the newly constructed object is set to
	an implementation-defined string value in the form of a Pattern based
	on [the one used in constructing the RegExp instance].
	
	(But) an implementation may choose to take advantage of `source` being
	allowed to be different from the source passed to the RegExp
	constructor to escape special characters. For example, in the
	regular expression obtained from new RegExp("/"), source could be,
	among other possibilities, "/" or "\/". The latter would permit the
	entire result ("/\//") of the toString call to have the form
	RegularExpressionLiteral.
	
	In ExtendScript, myRegExp.source is implemented (although not
	documented) and it returns a string that exactly reflects the inner
	pattern (w/o slashes and flags),

	      /a\\[a-zé\xE9\|]e+/g.source  =>  `a\\[a-zé\xE9\|]e+`
	
	But if the RegExp has been built using a string pattern, it
	is not safe to use its source in a literal regex, because:
	
	      RegExp("/").source  =>  `/`
	
	and /// yields undefined ; /\// should be used here, which
	by the way properly works regarding its `source` property:
	
	      /\//.source          =>  `\/`
	
	Similar comments could be done regarding RegExp(""), whose
	source is "" while it should be "(?:)" as suggested in [ECMA2009].
	
	Now, myRegExp.toString() returns the whole pattern string
	*including* in/out slashes and flags:
	
	      String(/a\\[a-zé\xE9\|]e+/g)  =>  `/a\\[a-zé\xE9\|]e+/g`
	
	Note, however, that flags are reordered in 'gim' order:
	
	      String(/abc/mig)     =>  `/abc/gim`
	
	But the issue remains regarding string-based RegExp:
	
	      String(RegExp("/"))  =>  `///`  (KO)
	
	which won't evaluate to the original regex (=>undefined).
	
	The method toSource() and the function uneval() are NOT properly
	implemented in CS4-CS6, while in CC they return a string of the
	form "(new RegExp(/xyz/f))". But the '/' test still fails:
	
	      eval(RegExp('/').toSource());  =>  ERROR! (due to ///)
	
	Thus, the safest way of stringifying a RegExp in all ExtendScript
	versions is not
	
	      "RegExp(" + String(myRegExp) + ")"   // almost good...
	
	Instead, we operate as described in RegExp.prototype.toSource()
	below, making sure that `/` and `\` are always treated the same
	way and do not lead to tricky issues.


	1. UPPERCASE DIGITS IN \uHHHH AND \xHH.
	__________________________________________________________________

	In CS4, escape sequences of the form \uHHHH and \xHH are not recognized
	if lowercase hexa digits are used in the RegExp pattern.

	E.g   /f\xeate/.test("fête")   // => CS4: false (KO) ; CS6/CC: true (OK)

	Workaround. - Always use uppercase hexa digits in literal regex,

	      /f\xEAte/.test("fête")   // => true (OK) all versions


	2. LASTINDEX ISSUE.
	__________________________________________________________________

	According to [ECMA], String.prototype.search(RegExp) shouldn't
	modify the lastIndex property of the regex. But ExtendScript has a
	generic issue in updating RegExp.lastIndex in various contexts. E.g:
	
	      var reg = /bar/;
	      alert( 'foobar'.search(reg) );    // => 3
	      alert( 'foobar'.search(reg) );    // => -1 !

	The second search(...) fails because reg.lastIndex has been modified
	during the first call. (This bug may be really harmful if you're used
	to 'precompile' your regex for optimization purpose.)

	Workaround. - Always set `reg.lastIndex=0` before each call to the
	search() method.


	3. CLASS RANGE AND DASH `-`.
	__________________________________________________________________

	[ECMA] The '-' character can be treated literally or it can denote a range.
	It is treated literally if it is the first or last character of ClassRanges,
	the beginning or end limit of a range specification, or immediately follows
	a range specification.

	In ExtendScript (all versions) the pattern /[a\x2Dz]/ is treated as the
	/[a-z]/ class range, that is, /[a\x2Dz]/.test('b')==true. In other words,
	`\x2D` is not a valid escape of `-` in that context.
	
	Workaround. - Use `\-` instead, or position the dash as specified in [ECMA].


	4. VERTICAL BAR `|` IN CLASS CONTEXT.
	__________________________________________________________________

	According to [ECMA], the characters that require escaping in class context
	are: '\' ']' '-' and ')'. In CS5, however, the pipe '|' may also require
	escaping.
	
	Workaround. - Use `\|` in any context.


	5. NEGATED CLASS BUG (CS4) --MAYBE RELATED TO BACKTRACKING.
	__________________________________________________________________

	In CS4, a negated class based on at least one range and additional items,
	such as [^a-cjk], seems to erroneously match the ending bound of the
	input string:
	
	      /xyz[^a-cjk]/.test("xyz")   // => CS4: true (KO) ; CS5+: false (OK)
	      "abc".search(/[^a-cjk]/)    // => CS4: 3 (KO) ; CS5+: -1 (OK)
	
	So, under the above conditions the CS4 engine behaves as if the input had
	a final ghost character which is regarded as matching the negated class.
	This bug is specific to the case where the negated class wants to match
	the end-of-string position, the regex works fine when the input string
	still provides character(s) to eat:
	
	      /xyz[^a-z0-9]/.test("xyz@")  // => true  (OK) all versions
	      /xyz[^a-z0-9]/.test("xyz5")  // => false (OK) all versions

	Workaround. - It is usually possible to use a negative lookahead rather
	than the negated class, subject that we also force the regex to consume
	one more char after the lookahead. So replacing `[^xxx]` by `(?![xxx]).`
	solves the problem:
	
	      /xyz(?![a-z0-9])./.test("xyz5")  // => false (OK) all versions
	      /xyz(?![a-z0-9])./.test("xyz@")  // => true  (OK) all versions
	      /xyz(?![a-z0-9])./.test("xyz")   // => false (OK) all versions

	      "xyz5".match(/xyz(?![a-z0-9])./) // => null  (OK) all versions
	      "xyz@".match(/xyz(?![a-z0-9])./) // => foo@  (OK) all versions
	      "xyz".match(/xyz(?![a-z0-9])./)  // => null  (OK) all versions


	6. BACKTRACKING BUGS (CS6 AND LATER.)
	__________________________________________________________________

	Note. - By default JS RegExp quantifiers are greedy, e.g `a*` entirely
	captures "aaaaaa". (One can make any quantifier non-greedy by
	adding ? after it, e.g. /a*?/, /a+?/, etc.)
	
	Greedy quantifiers ( +, *, {m,n} ) may cause issues in ExtendScript
	when mixed with optional sub-patterns, especially in CS6 and later.

	      /(aA?|bB?)+$/.test("bx")   // => CS4: false (OK) ; CS6-CC: FREEZE!

	      /(a|bB?)+$/.test("bx")     // => CS4: false (OK) ; CS6-CC: FREEZE!

	It sounds like these 'explosive quantifiers' are not properly addressed
	due to backtracking bugs that affect other parts of the regex engine.
	Thus, CS6-CC doesn't interpret the scheme /((A|B)|C)/ the right way:

	      /^((a|b)|c)+$/.test("ac")  // => CS4: true (OK) ; CS6-CC: false (KO)

	while

	      /^((a|b)|c)+$/.test("ca")  // => true  (OK) all versions

	Interestingly,

	      /^(c|(a|b))+$/.test("ac")  // => CC: true  (OK)
	      /^(c|(a|b))+$/.test("ca")  // => CC: true  (OK)

	Since /((A|B)|C)/ is equivalent to /(A|B|C)/ there is no reason--in
	principle--to use those additional capturing parentheses. However,
	a more robust rule should be observed to avoid flaws.
	
	Guess. - Maybe (5) and (6) symptoms reflect the same issue in opposite
	directions (CS4 vs. CS6-CC--not tested in CS5.) The reason why CS4
	wrongly returns 3 on `"abc".search(/[^a-cjk]/)`, advancing the index
	to the end of the input, could also be the reason why it succeeds in
	breaking the loop that affects CS6-CC on `/(aA?|bB?)+$/.test("bx")`.
	[To be investigated.]


	7. ISSUE INVOLVING THE NUL CHARACTER (U+0000)
	__________________________________________________________________

	ExtendScript 3.x (CS4) has several flaws in processing the NUL
	character, especially in the context of the split() method. Everything
	happens as if '\x00' was interpreted as a reserved value or something
	of a breakpoint. Given
	
	      s = "A\x00B\x00C\x00D";
	
	      s.split('\x00')  // => CS4: ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""] (KO)
	                       // => CS5: ["A", "B", "C", "D"] (OK)

	Also, String.prototype.replace() cannot properly address U+0000 in both
	CS4, CS5, and CS6--while String.prototype.match() seems to work.

	Workaround. - Rewrite the prototyped methods wherever needed! [TODO]

	// IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

	/*

	Two regexes may capture exactly the same matches despite different
	patterns. For example, /\d/ vs. /[0-9]/. However, we shall consider
	such regexes *distinct* in the current implementation, based on the
	fact that the patterns /\d/ and /[0-9]/ differ in syntax whatever
	their equivalent semantics. By contrast, /aa\rbb\x01/ should be
	regarded as strictly identical to /aa\x0Dbb\u0001/ in the sense those
	patterns actually map to the same characters.

	Thus, although not easily defined at a formal level, the identity
	operator over RegExp objects can be roughly approximated based on the
	`source` property. Even in ExtendScript's implementation, the same
	source always reflects the same pattern. That is, given two patterns
	P1 and P2 forming regular expressions R1 and R2 whose `source` strings
	are resp. S1 and S2, we always have:

	      S1 == S2  ->  P1 == P2   (from which we'll declare R1 == R2)

	For example, the source `x\/y` can be reached from either
	R1 = RegExp("x\\/y") or R2 = /x\/y/, and it turns out that those two
	regexes have the same underlying pattern, namely /x\/y/.

	Thus, checking whether R1.source == R2.source is SUFFICIENT to return
	R1 == R2. But having equal sources is not a NECESSARY condition, as
	the same pattern may have distinct sources. Noting that RegExp("x\\/y")
	actually reduces to RegExp("x/y"), we already have an obvious example
	at hand:

	      (a) RegExp("x/y").source == `x/y`

	      (b)        /x\/y/.source == `x\/y`

	also,

	      (c)    /x\u002Fy/.source == `x\u002Fy`

	which all describe the same pattern /x\/y/.

	Example 2:
	---------
	      (a) RegExp("x\\y").source == `x\y`   (== /x\y/.source)

	      (b)   RegExp("xy").source == `xy`    (== /xy/.source)

	both describe the pattern /xy/ --since \y means nothing but y.

	Example 3:
	---------
	(a) RegExp("x\\t").source == `x\t`   (== /x\t/.source)

	(b)  RegExp("x\t").source == `x<TB>` (== /x<TB>/.source)

	both describing the match `x<TB>`. (Note here that /x\t/ is
	in no way equivalent to /xt/!)
